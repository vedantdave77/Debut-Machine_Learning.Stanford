My First ever ML understanding, appriciate effort of Andrew Ng. Use MATLAB for coding 
- Acknowledgement: I am thankful to Dr. Andrew NG to make this course introductory, relevant to Real practice and most importantly keep it interesting in each bit of time. 
- On daily basis, I worked on every exercises more than 5 to 6 hours, also get help from open source Github, Coursera community. 
- Course is based on MATLAB, well we all know this tech is not that much useful in practical world, but still I appeal to start work with this MATLAB based course, because here, you need to write every code your ownself and this will keep you active for coding. 
- For depth understading my Professor. Dr. Ruzbeh Razahvi Far also recommended to start from this course, and I am thankful to all G.A. and T.A. who help me to clearly understand basic 
Following Topics are considered in this course.
